# NBA Cards App

This is a web app built using React that uses NBA data from an API. The web app has a card for each player that displays the player's name, team, division, and conference. It also allows you to sort the cards by team, division, and conference as well. This is the API used for this web app: https://app.balldontlie.io/. The API doesn't have any images, so the cards just display text.
